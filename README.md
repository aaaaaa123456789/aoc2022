# Advent of Code 2022 â€” in x64 assembly!

This is my attempt at the [Advent of Code 2022][aoc2022] challenges, in pure x64 assembly, without any libraries (not
even libc).  
Why? For fun, and because the early days are extremely easy and this makes them challenging. How often does someone
get to write a routine to read a line of input, or to parse a number?

This codebase builds using NASM 2.15.03, and probably (hopefully) any more recent 2.x version.
